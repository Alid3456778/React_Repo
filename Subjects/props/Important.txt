1.props is a feature where you send data from one file to another file using its features


<Prop or varaible_name types:proptotype />
    <Student />

<Student name:"Some_name" age:{Some_number} Boolien:{True false} />
    <Student name:"Ali" age:{12} Gender:{true} />

2.There are some  things in prop which are set to confirm its value is Right 
    in some case we give number in string and vice versa , for Avoiding that thing we give PropType

    import Proptype from 'prop-types'//this thing is in your node module;

    prop or Variable_name.propType={
        name:Proptype.string,  //also can add ".required for confirm getting some value"
        age:Proptype.number,
        Gender:Proptype.bool
    }


3.We can set Prop value in default ,we can use this thing when the user didnt sent the data in Prop

    import Proptype from 'prop-types'//this thing is in your node module;

    prop or Variable_name.defaultProps ={
        name:"Guest",
        age:0,
        Gender:"T"
    }
